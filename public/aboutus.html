      Established in 2023 by a group of passionate students, Foodiee Express was created to solve a common problem faced by many on-campus residents: limited time and options for meals. Our vision is to support students by providing a seamless way to access great food without sacrificing study time or social life. We value quality, reliability, and customer satisfaction above all else, making sure that every delivery arrives fresh and on time.
